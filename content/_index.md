## Goals

- Fun with UI Design
- Experiments

## Config

I use Hugo for built-in templating systems, easy postCSS config, and portability.

The only command used is `hugo server` with additional flags for development.

Everything else depends on postCSS config.

## PostCSS

I use built-in postCSS helpers and `hugo-debugprint`, and each theme has its own postCSS configuration:

```
/assets/one-page-alt/css/styles.css
/assets/one-page-alt/postcss.config.js
```

## Debug bar

```
/assets/debug-bar/css/styles.css
/assets/debug-bar/postcss.config.js
```

It's a classic admin bar, with some useful infos and familiar styles.
